## Information

Project developed as part of my coursework for College.<br>
This project is fully crated in Python with the general features required for basic flawless functionality - however, I wouldn't say it's production tested.<br>

> [!WARNING]
> This project is discontinued and will no longer receive any updates, but will be getting bug fixes reported under the <a href="https://github.com/Supermarcel10/Restaurant-Till-System/issues">Issues</a> tab. <br>
> Project may contain bugs, use at your own discression!

## Installation

The project does not have any automatic installation.<br>
You can pull the project and open main.py, then set up the python environment and install the required modules.<br>

You are free to edit and use parts of the code for your projects!

## Features

- [x] Easily changeable colour theme and font theme from config/UserDefinedConfigs.config
- [x] The menu and items can be changed in the config/declarations.py/declaration method. This is non ideal and should probably be changed to a database.
- [x] Popup class for creating custom popups that can be dismissed and return a boolean value. This allows easy confirmation popups and warnings.
- [x] Supports custom edits for each dish (in this case pizza properties like size, toppings and such) which affect the end price of the product.
- [x] Double clicking on the product in the main menu view will bring up information as well as the option to remove the item.

This python script does not have any payment taking methods.
